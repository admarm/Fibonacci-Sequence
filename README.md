# Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci Sequence made in C++

The program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number or retrieves a specific Fibonacci number, while measuring the execution time.

# Usage
The program can be run through the executable (.exe) or by using a terminal with '**./fib**', with or without arguments.

Another way of entering the arguments via the terminal is by entering the first one, hitting enter, and then entering the second one.
